      <h3>This website will introduce you to (almost) every aspect of Diamond's top floor, including what rooms you can use, what activities, events happen here and much more!</h3>
      <h3>But first a little bit of history. According to Univeristy of Sheffield official website the Diamond is the largest investment for teaching and learning Sheffield has ever seen, costing around Â£81 million.</h3>
      <h3>Its construction began on site in 2013 and was finished on September 28th 2015. The magnificient building has an aluminium diamond shaped facade exterior, with steel sheets and glass, all.</h3>
      <h3>The interior, is even more amazing! It has six floors, with lecture theaters, seminar rooms, library and even IT services. To my mind, the best thing about diamond is that it is open 24/7 for all students.</h3>
      <h3>If you would like to know more, check out all the details about the Diamond on its official web page: <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/diamond">https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/diamond</a></h3>
